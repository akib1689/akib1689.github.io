# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. It is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It is hosted using Github Pages. This is created with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Github Pages

This project uses github pages using the `Github Actions` to deploy the project. The deployment is currently hosted into My personal Website [https://akib1689.github.io](https://akib1689.github.io)
